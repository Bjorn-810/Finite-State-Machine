Unity State Machine Example
This project demonstrates a basic state machine in Unity, showing how to handle internal state transitions (logic within states) and external overrides (e.g., user input).

Key Features
	Internal Transitions: StateOne automatically switches to StateTwo after 5 seconds.
	External Overrides: Press G to reset the state machine to StateOne from any state.

Purpose
This is not a full documentation but an example to show how state machine logic can be implemented.
